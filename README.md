# Green-Trade-Policy-in-the-Developing-World
Simple regression based projection I did looking at Green Trade policy if implemented unilaterally by developing economies.
I am trying to show it might be a pretty good policy option.

The work includes a panel data regression and some tests for model selection, 
as well as some experimentation transforming the data in SQL and showing some stuff in with ggplot2.
